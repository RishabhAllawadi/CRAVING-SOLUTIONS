In both these cases, Craving Solutions is merely acting as an intermediary between you and the Delivery Partners, or you and the Restaurant Partner or the Store, as the case may be.</p>
      <p>e. The acceptance by a Delivery Partner of undertaking delivery of your order shall constitute a contract of service under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019 or any successor legislations, between you and the Delivery Partner, to which Craving Solutions is not a party under any applicable law.

      <p>h. In addition to the Delivery Charges, you may also be charged an amount towards delivery surge for delivery of your order facilitated by the Delivery Partner or the Restaurant Partner or the Store, which is determined on the basis of various factors including but not limited to distance covered, time taken, demand for delivery, real time analysis of traffic and weather conditions, seasonal peaks or such other parameters as may be determined from time to time (<strong>“Delivery Surge"</strong>).

      <p>b. <strong>On Time Guarantee:</strong> For Craving Solutions Gold members in India, orders at select Restaurant Partners may have this service auto-enabled. When enabled, Craving Solutions uses its technology platform to allocate a suitable delivery partner, who provides the service, in such a way that it minimises the delays in the orders. This includes prioritising allocation of Delivery Partners, along with making sure these orders are not clubbed with any other orders. However, you acknowledge that such services are facilitated by the Delivery Partner on a best effort basis, hence should your order fail to reach you on or prior to the On Time Guarantee Time, you would be eligible to claim and receive a coupon of up to 100% of your order value. You will be required to claim the Coupon within twenty four (24) hours from the time such Order is delivered to you failing which your eligibility to receive the Coupon will expire.

      <p>For the purpose of this clause, words capitalised shall have the following meaning: “On Time Guarantee Time" shall mean the Promised Delivery Time, which starts when the order is accepted by the Restaurant Partner. The actual delivery time will be counted as the period between the Restaurant Partner accepting the order and the Delivery Partner reaching within 100 metre radius from your location or first barrier point (security guard/reception etc.) whichever is earlier. “Coupon" shall mean one-time code generated by Craving Solutions for delay in On Time Guarantee Time to be used as per applicable conditions.</p>
